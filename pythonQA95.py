# Write a Python program to count the number of carry operations for each addition problem.

# According to Wikipedia " In elementary arithmetic, a carry is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits to another column of more significant digits. 
# It is part of the standard algorithm to add numbers together by starting with the rightmost digits and working to the left. 
# For example, when 6 and 7 are added to make 13, the "3" is written to the same column and the "1" is carried to the left".

def carried(x,y):
    ctr =0
    # here mentioning the current carry to 0
    if x ==0 and y==0:
        return 0
    z = 0
    
    for i in reversed(range(10)):
        z = x % 10 +y % 10 +z
        
        if z >9:
            z =1
        else:
            z=0
        ctr +=z
        
        x //=10
        y //=10
    if ctr ==0:
        return "no carry"
    elif ctr ==1:
        return ctr
    else:
        return ctr
print(carried(876,789))
